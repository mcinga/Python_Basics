# Python basic

The aim of this projects is to remind my self of the python basics.
The projects are tiny, and simple but as they progress they become more complex but they use real world problems.
The projects include how to create functions, how to create and write into text files and how to import such functions and how to create functions that can read fasta files.
This will be particulary valuable to those who do not havea python background and biologists who would be keen into goinginginto bioinformatics
